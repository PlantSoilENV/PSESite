This is known as the ‘Plant and Cap’ strategy; however, this technology does not guarantee successful plant establishment due to the variable soil quality of capping materials. Potential factors affecting soil quality include: i) origin of stockpile materials; ii) duration and depth of storage; and iii) changes in soil properties during storage. A better understanding of the associations between soil properties and plant establishment is needed for successful revegetation. Our experiments combine non-invasive characterization of root system development in rhizoboxes with analysis of microbial communities in root-influenced soil. Preliminary results indicated a strong influence of the quality and depth of capping materials on plant performance. Further analysis of the relationships between identified variables will help elucidate the effect of the capping material soil parameters (e.g., physical and chemical properties, storage depth and time) on successful revegetation in ‘Plant and Cap’ strategy.

The goal of the project is to identify native plant species that accumulate metals by employing portable x-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (XRF) and test them for their ability to i) hyperaccumulate target metals, ii) produce biomass, iii) proliferate roots. The subsequent plant biomass will be used in high-value, sustainable chemistry reactions to produce a new generation of eco-catalysts. We also hypothesize that the phytoremediation of the legacy mine is most likely to be successful with native, locally adapted plants, and this hypothesis is based on evidence from preliminary studies.</p>

However, there is a paucity of information on plant metal accumulation in arid and semi-arid climatic regions, which presents a challenge for the selection of plant species for phytoextraction. To address this gap, this project focuses on conducting extensive in-situ surveys of legacy mine sites and natural outcrops in Arizona, using a portable X-ray fluorescence analyzer (pXRF). pXRF rapidly characterizes metal accumulation in plant tissues, spanning across various plant families. To date, using this technology, we have been able to identify numerous species with a significant capacity for uptake of Copper (Cu), Selenium (Se), Zinc (Zn) and Rhenium (Re).</p>

Innovative techniques are essential for the rapid and large-scale characterization of elemental contents in desert plants. In this study, we enhance the identification process using hyperspectral imaging in conjunction with Portable X-Ray Fluorescence spectroscopy (pXRF). This combination will allow for in situ detection and estimation of metal contents in plants. We validate this method through the use of handheld hyperspectral cameras, examining the spectral signatures of target metals in plants exposed to varied metal concentrations hydroponically. Once validated, hyperspectral cameras will be deployed on UAVs to conduct extensive investigation of metal uptake in plants across many legacy mine sites in Arizona.</p>

Initiating and maintaining plant growth in arid regions is challenging because of limited soil moisture and excessive solar radiation.  Agrivoltaic technology involves strategically situating agricultural activities beneath solar photovoltaic panels, fostering a symbiotic relationship between energy conversion processes.  Evapotranspiration emanating from the soil and vegetation interacts with the solar panels above, effectively cooling them and enhancing their operational efficiency.  Concurrently, the solar panels provide shade to the flora and soil, mitigating heat- and drought-stress on plants while bolstering soil’s capacity to retain moisture.  This integrated infrastructure also facilitates the provision of ecosystem services such as habitat creation and carbon sequestration. Studies have demonstrated that agrivoltaic systems exhibit enhanced germination rates, reduced plant mortality, and increased vegetative yields, underscoring their multifaceted advantages.</p>

                                    <p class="text-justify team_desc">Given the demonstrated efficacy of agrivoltaic systems in enhancing plant growth and the increasing demand for revegetation and remediation of metal-contaminated areas, there emerged a necessity to delve into the underlying mechanisms driving the success of agrivoltaic systems.  This ongoing study aims to assess the performance of tepary beans (Phaseolus acutifolius) grown under solar panels compared to open-field conditions, examining plant development, yield, and plant-microbe interactions during one growing season.  Preliminary results show that Tepary beans exhibit higher agricultural performance under solar panels, evidenced by multiple plant traits.  Ongoing comparative analyses of the soil microbial diversity and abundance will elucidate potential synergistic relationships between soil health and plant productivity under agrivoltaic settings.  This inquiry is pivotal in expanding the application of agrivoltaics beyond traditional agricultural activities to encompass phytoremediation endeavors.  The combination of these offers hope for a more sustainable future through innovative solutions.</p>

The study area comprised disturbed soil from copper mining activity that happened almost a century ago. So, we assumed the soil may contain elevated levels of toxic metal(loid)s that pose a hazard to plants and humans/animals. The plants capable of growing in such soil with stressful conditions are usually adapted to tolerate or accumulate toxic elements without showing any signs/symptoms of toxicity. Thus, we aimed to identify any unique plants that can accumulate any such elements above the toxic threshold. Plant shoot and soil samples were collected and brought to the lab for elemental analysis using PXRF analyzer.</p>

The soil analysis revealed elevated levels of Zn (mean-271, min-218, max-325 mg/kg) and Cu (mean-394, min-279, max-682) while compared against their levels found in contiguous US soils (95th percentile: Zn-125mg/kg, Cu-43 mg/kg) (Smith et al, 2014). These two elements are essential micronutrients that become toxic to plants at higher levels. Out of 23 species analyzed, Atriplex canescens was the only species that had accumulated Zn and Cu above the toxic threshold. This native species is a drought-tolerant, halophytic perennial shrub adapted to the unforgiving arid climates of the US Southwest. Hence, we have selected it as a model plant species to study its metal acquisition traits in controlled conditions.</p>
